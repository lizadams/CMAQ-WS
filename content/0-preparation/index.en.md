This workshop walks you through setting up your own Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling environment. You learn how to navigate the AWS Management Console, access relevant services, and how to deploy a basic infrastructure. Specifically, you learn how to:


* Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.
* Deploy the AWS ParallelCluster UI stack.

You can proceed to the next stage of the workshop once the preparation is complete and the necessary stacks are deployed.
