title: CMAQ Benchmark Data on S3 Bucket
weight: 23
---

The CMAS Data Warehouse within the Registry of Open Data on AWS contains several S3 buckets that are open to public use.

The CMAQ Benchmark Data used for this training comes from the following S3 bucket.

   ![cmaq benchmark data on s3](/static/images/2-cmaq-benchmark-data-s3.png)

Instructions:

1. **Click on [Browse Bucket](https://cmas-cmaq.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to explore the data on the S3 bucket**

Output:

![cmaq benchmark data on s3](/static/images/2-browse-cmas-cmaq-s3-bucket.png)

Note, this data is uncompressed and saved in a directory structure that matches the CMAQ Benchmark scripts.


2. **Review the top section of the readme.html**

```csh
https://cmas-cmaq.s3.amazonaws.com/readme.html
```

Output (top 6 lines)

3. **Query how much data is in the 12US1 benchmark case**

```csh
aws s3 ls --summarize --human-readable --recursive s3://cmas-cmaq/CMAQv5.4_2018_12US1_Benchmark_2Day_Input
```

Output:

```
Total Objects: 247
   Total Size: 84.9 GiB

```

4. **How to copy data to local filesystem** (optional)

Command to copy files from the bucket to your local filesystem (the system where you are running the aws cli) and place it under the path that you specify for /your_local_path.

```csh
aws s3 --no-sign-request cp --recursive s3://cmas-cmaq/CMAQv5.4_2018_12US1_Benchmark_2Day_Input /your_local_path/
```

Output (demonstrating the high transfer rate of 27Mib/sec)
