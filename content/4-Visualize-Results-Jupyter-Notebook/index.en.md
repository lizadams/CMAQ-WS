There are additional methods to create plots of CMAQ Output Data, and some of this is being shared as scripts.
Typically these files end in an extention that reflects their contents as follows:
R (.R), Python (.py), and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)


To run an R script from the command line, use:

```
Rscript r-file-name.R
```

To run a Python script from the command line, use:

```
python python-file-name.py
```

To run the code interactively as a Jupyter Notebook, use the command:

```
cd /path/to/jupter-notbook-location
jupter notebook
```

The jupyter notebook will appear in the web browser on the machine.

For this training, you will use the DCV.

NICE DCV is a high-performance remote display protocol that provides customers with a secure way to deliver remote desktops and application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device, over varying network conditions.
