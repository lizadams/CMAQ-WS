   The CMAQ output files from the Base and DESID Emission Reduction CMAQ runs were pre-saved to the /shared/build/openmpi-gcc/CMAQv5.4+/data/output directory.
This will allow you to try out the Jupyter Notebook and the VERDI visualizations without needing to complete the CMAQ runs that output to the /fsx/data/output directory.
