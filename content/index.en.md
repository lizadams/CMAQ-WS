title: "CMAQ on AWS HPC Workshop"
weight: 00
---

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your air quality workloads. High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are built on high performance processors with high speed memory, storage, and networking. With virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, HPC system administrators, and organizations can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible HPC cluster configurations and virtually unlimited scalability allows you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services for Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), you can reinvent traditional Air Quality Modeling workflows to derive results faster and under budget.

Doing all parts of this workshop should take approximately 3 hours.

This workshop is designed for modelers who want to learn more about running CMAQ using AWS HPC.
